## Project Proposal: NBA Player Statistics Analysis and Prediction System

### Overview
Develop a basketball player statistics analysis and prediction system using machine learning techniques with NBA player datasets. The system aims to provide insights into player performance and predict player stats based on historical player data. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms and the comprehensive NBA player statistics dataset.

### Data
Utilize NBA datasets from APIs, including the following sources:
- [2022-2023 NBA Player Stats - Regular](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/20222023-nba-player-stats-regular?select=2022-2023+NBA+Player+Stats+-+Regular.csv)
-[2021-2022 NBA Player Stats - Regular](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/nba-player-stats)

### Objectives
- Predict basketball player stats for the upcoming season based on historical data
- Leverage player stats from the previous year to forecast player performance
- Identify suitable machine learning algorithms for scalability, accuracy, and interpretability in predicting player performance.
- Evaluate the performance of the prediction system and ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, such as team selection and player scouting.

### Methodology
1. Data Collection: Gather a large dataset from APIs mentioned above.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, encode, and engineer features from the NBA datasets.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Gain insights, patterns, and analyze feature distributions.
4. Model Training and Evaluation: Experiment with ML algorithms, fine-tune for accurate predictions.
5. User Interface Development: Create an intuitive interface for users to input player data they wish to see.
6. Testing and Validation: Ensure the accuracy, robustness, and scalability of the prediction system.
