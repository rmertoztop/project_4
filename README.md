# Spotify Music Recommendation System

## Overview

This project aims to develop a music recommendation system using machine learning techniques with Spotify datasets. The goal is to provide accurate and personalized song recommendations based on user preferences by leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms and Spotify's vast music catalogue.

## Data

We will utilize Spotify datasets from Kaggle, including the following sources:

- [Spotify Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset)
- [Spotify Dataset 2](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset)

## Objectives

- Predict user preferences and recommend songs aligned with their musical taste.
- Leverage audio features to effectively capture user preferences and song similarities.
- Identify suitable machine learning algorithms for scalability, accuracy, and interpretability.
- Evaluate the performance of the recommendation system and ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Methodology

1. Data Collection: Gather a large dataset from Kaggle as indicated above.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data, including normalization, encoding, and feature engineering from the Spotify datasets.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Gain insights, identify patterns, and analyze feature distributions.
4. Model Training and Evaluation: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, fine-tuning them for accurate recommendations.
5. User Interface Development: Create an intuitive interface for personalized song recommendations.
6. Testing and Validation: Ensure the accuracy, robustness, and scalability of the recommendation system.

## Tools
