# NBA Player Statistics Analysis and Prediction System

## Overview
This project aims to develop a basketball player statistics analysis and prediction system using machine learning techniques with NBA player datasets. The system utilizes historical player data to provide insights into player performance and predict player stats for the upcoming season. By leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms and the comprehensive NBA player statistics dataset.

## Data
The project utilizes two NBA player statistics datasets from Kaggle:
1. [2021-2022 NBA Player Stats - Regular](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/nba-player-stats): This dataset contains player statistics for the 2021-2022 NBA season.
2. [2022-2023 NBA Player Stats - Regular](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/20222023-nba-player-stats-regular?select=2022-2023+NBA+Player+Stats+-+Regular.csv): This dataset contains player statistics for the 2022-2023 NBA season.
These datasets provide comprehensive information on various player attributes, such as points, assists, rebounds, shooting percentages, and more.

## Objectives
- Predict basketball player stats for the upcoming season based on historical data.
- Leverage player stats from the previous year to forecast player performance.
- Identify suitable machine learning algorithms for scalability, accuracy, and interpretability in predicting player performance.
- Evaluate the performance of the prediction system and ensure its effectiveness in real-world scenarios, such as team selection and player scouting.

## Methodology
1. Data Collection: Gather a large dataset of NBA player statistics from the Kaggle dataset.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, encode, and engineer features from the NBA dataset.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Gain insights, patterns, and analyze feature distributions.
4. Model Training and Evaluation: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, fine-tune models for accurate predictions.
5. User Interface Development: Create an intuitive interface for users to input player data and view predictions.
6. Testing and Validation: Ensure the accuracy, robustness, and scalability of the prediction system.

## Challenges Faced
During the course of the project, we encountered several challenges:
- Bad Encoding: The original data had encoding issues that we struggled to handle. We had to apply encoding techniques to ensure proper handling and interpretation of the data.
- External Factors: While player statistics provide valuable insights, it's important to note that other factors can influence a player's performance on the court. Factors such as injuries, team dynamics, coaching strategies, and external circumstances were not included in our analysis. Considering these external factors could further enhance the accuracy and predictive power of the model.

## Outliers
To handle these outliers, we implemented a post-processing step where we replaced any negative predicted values with zeros. This approach allowed us to address the outliers and ensure that the predicted statistics remain within a valid range. By zeroing out the negative values, we mitigated the impact of outliers on the model's performance and ensured that the predicted player statistics align with the expectations of NBA player performance.

## Results
The prediction system achieved an impressive R-squared value of 0.9998, indicating a high level of accuracy in predicting player statistics based on the historical data.
However, it is essential to note that player performance can be influenced by various external factors that were not considered in this analysis. Factors such as injuries, team dynamics, coaching strategies, and external circumstances can significantly impact a player's performance on the court. Therefore, it is important to interpret the predicted player statistics with caution and consider the broader context in which the players operate.

## Conclusion
The NBA Player Statistics Analysis and Prediction System leverages historical player data, applies machine learning techniques, and provides valuable insights and predictions on player performance. The system can assist with team selection, player scouting, and forecasting player statistics for the upcoming season.
